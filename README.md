### Feedback & Issues

The Mac OS version is slightly less tested than the Linux and Windows versions so it might be more prone to errors than the other releases. That being said, all versions need more testing and could showcase bugs and errors. 

The best thing to do in case you stumble upon a bug is to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/issues/new), attaching a screenshot and a copy of the logs describing the error. Moreover, a description of the steps required to reproduce the error would be fantastic!

On the other hand, if you have an idea that you’d like to share with us don’t be shy - we have a [Slack](http://akasha-slack.herokuapp.com/) channel for [brainstorming ideas](https://akashaproject.slack.com/messages/ideas/) and we’d love to hear from you! 


### A Special Note On AETH (AKASHA ETH)

AETH is our test token on the private chain used for this pre-release. As a test token it does not have any value outside the purpose of testing AKASHA. At this point, you can obtain AETH tokens by creating an identity on AKASHA.


### FAQs

A list of FAQs is being built [on this Wiki](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/wiki/FAQ) - make sure you check it in case you stumble upon a problem.
